Which audiences did you consider, and which one did you settle on for your app?

We considered college students, teens, and adults. For our app, we decided to settle on our audience being adults, specifically those interested in online shopping and using new cosmetic products

List the ten needs that you identified for your chosen audience

Food, Time Management, Organization, News, Leisure, Entertainment (Shows, etc), Music, Art inspiration, Fashion, Fitness

State the three needs that were chosen out of the ten, and state the projects that you mapped to those needs

The three needs we chose were: Food, Time Management, and Fashion/cosmetics. The projects that we mapped to these needs were the following: A cookbook (food), Schedule creator (time management), and a makeup index (fashion/cosmetics).

For each of the three projects, list the goals/ideas that you brainstormed for them
  
  Food: A cookbook that allows users to have access to an index of recipes to follow, can store blogs with experiences with recipes, etc.
  
  Schedule creator: A schedule to allow users to keep track of activites they need to do today. Saved through a database
  
  Makeup index: A record with a list of various makeup products, filtered by types of products. Saved through a database

State the “winner” of this process

The winner of this process that we concluded was the Makeup index.
